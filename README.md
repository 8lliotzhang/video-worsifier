<h1>Worsifier!</h1>
We're making videos MORE NOSTALGIC by removing sound and making it look cool with ASCII art. 
It's not copyright infringment cuz we're not making money or anything.

<h3>Using The Worsifier</h3>
If for whatever reason you want to use this, make sure you follow some steps:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Open the file ascify-pwp.py.</li>
<li>Install ascii_magic: Go to terminal, run 'pip install ascii_magic'.</li>
<li>Install cv: run 'pip install opencv-python'.</li>
<li>Ensure ALL required packages and dependencies are installed correctly.</li>
<li>Really, really make sure you got all of them.</li>
<li>Have an mp4 file that you plan to convert into an ASCII movie.</li>
<li>On line 16, reference the correct mp4 file in the videos subfolder (or wherever u put it).</li>
<li>You should now be able to run the python file - adjust the terminal size for the optimal screen size.</li>
<li>For best results perform incantations during the loading sequence.</li>

</ol>

<h3>The Systems</h3>
<h4>Ascify-PWP</h4>
This system <b>P</b>rints images <b>W</b>hile <b>P</b>rocessing hence its name. It works pretty quickly and pretty well on most videos. Does not support audio at all sadly.

<h4>Ascifier2</h4>
This system uses state-of-the-art Techni-Audio systems (Harry spent hours syncing up the audio). Uses an library of pre-rendered ASCII for real fast (and throttlable) animations! Supports variable FPS, audio (requires much fine-tuning).
