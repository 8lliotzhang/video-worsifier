<h1>Worsifier!</h1>
We're making videos MORE NOSTALGIC by removing sound and making it look cool with ASCII art. 
It's not copyright infringment cuz we're not making money or anything.

</ul>

<h3>The Systems</h3>
<h4>Ascify-PWP</h4>
This system <b>P</b>rints images <b>W</b>hile <b>P</b>rocessing hence its name. It works pretty quickly and pretty well on most videos. Does not support audio at all sadly.

<h4>Ascifier2</h4>
This system uses state-of-the-art Techni-Audio systems (Harry spent hours syncing up the audio). Uses an library of pre-rendered ASCII for real fast (and throttlable) animations! Supports variable FPS, audio (requires much fine-tuning).
